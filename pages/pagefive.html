        A perfect baked potato has crispy skin and fluffy insides. My method for how to bake a potato works every time, so load up your spuds, and dig in!</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato</li>
            <li>Oil</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How To Cook</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, preheat the oven to 425, and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>While the oven preheats, prep the potatoes. Scrub the potatoes well and pat them dry with a kitchen towel. Then, poke the potatoes with a fork a few times to create small holes across their surfaces.</li>
            <li>Next, season the potatoes. Place them on the baking sheet and rub them all over with olive oil. Sprinkle them liberally with sea or kosher salt, and transfer them to the hot oven to bake.</li>
            <li>Bake for 45 to 60 minutes, until the skins are crisp and puffy and you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork. Use oven mitts to remove the hot baking sheet from the oven.</li>
            <li>Finally, dig in! Allow the potatoes cool for a few minutes before slicing them open, fluffing up their insides, and topping them with your favorite fixings. I like cashew sour cream, tempeh bacon, chives, and salt and pepper!</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Enjoy!</h4>
